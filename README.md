# IVDR
The idea of this project is to make an IVDR using CAN communication protocol.

This project is under development, currently working on the software that Arduino will use to read the information. As it is an experimental project, a second Arduino is used to emulate the car. This second Arduino uses the code "write.ino" to send messages through CAN.

The module MCP2515 is used to allow communication via CAN protocol.
